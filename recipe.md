I am giving a step wise explanation:

 In the pan give two table spoon refined oil.
 Keeping the flame medium, let the oil become hot enough.
 At this moment add half the butter told in the ing section.
 Add grated onion and a pinch of suger and salt.
 When the oil has made the onion half boild add ginger garlic paste and coriander powder.
 Also add grated tomato. Add 1/2 tea spoon chilli powder and green chillis.
 Keep tossing until the oil comes out from the masala.
 Now add curd and the poppy and cashew paste.
 And add salt, according to taste.
 Now, have to toss it for a while, because there is a chance of stiking the curry in the pan.
 Add one and a half cup of water to it.
 Now add the semi - fried panner to it.
 After a couple of minutes add the rest of the butter to it.
 And add the cream and half tea spoon "garam masala".
 Now toss it for a minute or two.
